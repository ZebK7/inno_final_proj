    <h4>The first Motorcycle Companies</h4>

    <div class="container">
    
    <p>Now-forgotten firms, such as Hildebrand & Wolfmuller of Germany, were among the first production motorcycle companies. But, the names you probably recognize began popping up around the turn of the 20th century. The legendary UK manufacturer, Royal Enfield, began producing motorcycles in 1901, and Triumph and Indian started in 1902. <br>Then came the company that changed it all: Harley-Davidson. In 1903, William Harley, along with his partners, the brothers Arthur and Walter Davidson, launched Harley-Davidson out of a wooden shack in Milwaukee that served as their makeshift machine shop. After many failed prototypes and false starts, they hit upon a workable design in 1905 and began mass-producing early motorcycles that year.  </p>In 1909, Harley-Davidson released the first V-Twin motorcycle engine. This dual-cylinder engine was the game-changer that allowed Harley to break the market wide open. The company got another boost from World War I, in which the US government purchased tens of thousands of Harley-Davidson motorcycles for use on the front lines. The modern variants of the Harley V-Twin remain a cornerstone element of the H-D product lineup to this day. <br>Other motorcycle companies also continued to make important contributions in this era. The famous Triumph Model H, known as the 'Trusty Triumph', was one of the most popular motorcycles of WWI, with over 57,000 units manufactured. The Model H was also among the first mass-produced motorcycles that lacked pedals, which is why its commonly considered to be one of the first “true” motorcycles. </p>
